# MLB_Pitcher_Usage_Rprogram


## Introduction

This baseball analyst project demonstrates how to use R to generate baseball reports in a simple matter. This project using a single 'main' r script to input/source different functions and data files based on user input.

This project is broken down into multiple parts: 
*  Generate data using the baseballr package (data_generation_script.Rmd)
*  Create multiple functions (pitcher_usage_function.R & pitch_load.R) to process and format pitcher usage data
*  Saves output and flags heavy workload - similar to the pitcher usage tables on Fangraphs
